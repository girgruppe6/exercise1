[By reporters Duanmu Laidi (4551 2606 0171 1229) and Gao Jianxin (7559 1696 2450)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 25 Feb (XINHUA) -- The political affairs 
group of the preliminary working committee for the Preparatory 
Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] 
held its fifth meeting here 24-25 February. The meeting 
discussed and studied the relationship between the 
administrative and legislative organs of the Hong Kong SAR, the 
method of forming the first government -- including the method 
and timing of the election of the administrative commissioner 
and how to form the administrative council and its functions -- 
and the establishment of a consultative committee and its 
functions after 1997. 
  After the meeting, the group's leaders Liang Zhenying and 
Xiao Weiyun gave briefings to reporters. Xiao Weiyun said: The 
administrative organ shall be the leading component of Hong 
Kong's future political system. The Basic Law provides explicit 
stipulations that the administrative and legislative organs 
should check and balance while coordinating with each other. 
Only by keeping the administrative organ as the leading 
component will the government operate efficiently, society 
remain stable, the economy prosper, and living standards be 
improved. This is the principle we will adhere to at all times. 
If anyone, by playing small or big tricks, tries to change the 
system which upholds the administrative organ's leading position 
before 1997, such changes will certainly be rescinded after 1 
July 1997 because they are not in line with the interests of the 
people in Hong Kong and are not conducive to its long-term 
stability and prosperity. 
  Responding to a reporter's question on how China could 
"start 
a new stove," Xiao Weiyun said, Patten's "constitutional reform 
package" [zheng gai fang an -- 2398 2395 2455 2714] violates the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Hong Kong Basic Law, and the 
agreements reached between China and Britain. Now Britain, 
doggedly going its own way, has submitted the package for 
adoption by the British Hong Kong Legislative Council. This 
means that the door to Sino-British negotiations has been shut 
by Britain's disruption. Needless to say, the Chinese Government 
will "start a new stove" according to the provisions of the 
Basic Law. To this end, the preliminary working committee will 
step up efforts and do solid work to ensure a smooth transition 
of power and the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong.

  [Editorial Report] 
THE STAR
  Call for Disbanding of Homeland Armies -- Greg Mills, 
director of studies at the South African Institute of 
International Affairs, writes in an article on page 16 of 
Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 16 March that in the new 
South Africa homeland bureaucracies "have to remain in place, as 
there is already a shortage of trained civil servants." 
However, the homeland military forces "should no longer remain 
intact." "Since independence, the record of these armed 
formations has been blighted by the incidence of intervention 
and instability." Mills says the homeland armies should be 
disbanded as "distinct ethnic units," and instead, the emphasis 
"should be placed on regimental and not political or ethnic 
allegiances." 
 BUSINESS DAY
  De Klerk `Shied' Away From AWB -- "It is time to halt the 
AWB's [Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging; Afrikaner Resistance 
Movement] paramilitary posturing and to end its delusions of 
martial grandeur," declares a page-16 editorial in Johannesburg 
BUSINESS DAY in English on 16 March. "The Bophuthatswana 
excursion should have convinced government or the Transitional 
Executive Council that the AWB's activities must be stopped. 
That does not mean banning it. Like any other organisation, it 
is entitled to meet and propagate unpopular views -- but as 
civilians." "Despite the challenge at the World Trade Centre, 
despite confrontations which have cost lives in Ventersdorp and 
now Mmabatho, President F.W. de Klerk has shied away from 
dealing with this fascist force. The next government will not 
be so timid, but the time to pull the AWB's claws is now." 
  `Expedience' in AWB, CP Link With Black Groups -- 
Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 16 March in a page-10 
editorial believes "there is enough evidence to show that many 
Afrikaners do not support the hysteria evinced by the factions 
under Eugene Terreblanche [AWB leader] and Ferdi Hartzenberg 
[leader of the Conservative Party]. What makes their so-called 
link with black conservative groups odious, is that it is based 
more on expedience and opportunism in the fight against the ANC 
and its allies than coalescence of conviction."
